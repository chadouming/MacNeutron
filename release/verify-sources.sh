# verify-sources.sh <MacNeutron-X.Y.Z-source.tar.gz> <SOURCE> (gate R5, arm64 release spec §7.2, §14): the archive holds
# the source of exactly what the bundle's SOURCE names. Checks, one FAIL line per gap, then PASS sources:
# - each tree's tar names its applied commit (git get-tar-commit-id; lsteamclient's, a worktree tar, file by file against
#   that commit's blobs); the repository's is MACNEUTRON_COMMIT;
# - in the build trees (build/wine-arm64-src), <applied>~<patch count> is SOURCE's *_COMMIT, which is also the archived
#   pins'; the patch count is the archived patch folder's;
# - each *_SERIES recomputed from the archived pins and patches, with the archived lib.sh's tree_series;
# - each submodule's tar against the gitlink its tree records at the tree's applied commit, and against SOURCE's
#   FEX_SUBMODULE_* and DXMT_SUBMODULE_*, one for one;
# - each tarball's SHA-256 against SOURCE's *_SHA256;
# - LLVM_TAG and LLVM_MINGW_SHA256 cited only: present in SOURCE, equal to the archived dxmt/pins.
# Read-only. BUILD_DIR replaces build/.
