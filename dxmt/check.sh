# Our DXMT on the arm64 runtime, no Steam (DXMT fork spec §6, arm64 DXMT spec §7, arm64 release spec §8.2). Needs
# `make build wine-arm64 dxmt-tests presenter` (`dxmt-tests-arm64ec` too for the ARM64EC programs) and the frozen
# Rosetta reference (tools/freeze-rosetta-reference.sh; MACNEUTRON_REFERENCE names another). The checks run on two tool
# folders in the work folder (DXMT_CHECK_WORK overrides it): "ours", assembled by `macneutron install` from wine.app
# (MACNEUTRON_ARM64_APP, default build/wine-arm64/wine.app), runs our DXMT through the launcher just built; "ref", an
# APFS clone of the frozen tool, runs D3DMetal, the reference, under Rosetta through its own launcher. Neither the
# installed tool folders nor the reference is written. Our DXMT runs the programs in MACNEUTRON_ARM64_TESTS and
# MACNEUTRON_ARM64_LOOP (default: the x64 ones, which D3DMetal always runs), dxil-probe and dxil-translate from
# MACNEUTRON_ARM64_TOOLS (default build/wine-arm64).
