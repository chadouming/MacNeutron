# - arm64 (ship-base spec §7), when MACNEUTRON_ARM64_APP names a wine.app: the aarch64 steam.exe and helper on that
#   runtime, run directly in the booted prefix MACNEUTRON_ARM64_PREFIX (wine-arm64/check.sh's).
# - a tool folder, MACNEUTRON_TOOL_DIR (assembled with `macneutron install … --steam-exe`), or else $WORK/tool,
#   assembled here from build/wine-arm64/wine.app: the same rows directly in its prefix, then through its launcher.
# BRIDGE_CHECK_WORK replaces the folder the helper's files (and, with a tool folder, the compat folder) go in.
