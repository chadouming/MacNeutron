# Developer end-to-end check of the Steam bridge (bridge spec §4.3). Needs Steam running and logged in, `make bridge`,
# and a wine.app: the bundle's ARM64X lsteamclient.dll as steamclient64.dll, the aarch64 steam.exe, and the x64
# steamprobe.exe under FEX with its fault check. Prints your SteamID and persona name: don't paste them anywhere public.
#   bridge/probe.sh <path to a game's steam_api64.dll>
# ACCOUNT=<id> sets MACNEUTRON_STEAM_ACCOUNT; APPID=<id> replaces 480; WINEDEBUG=+steamclient shows the bridge's log.
# PROBE_REDACT=1 prints only the probe's own rows, with "steamid ok" and "persona ok" for the values (WINEDEBUG=-all).
# STEAM_COMPAT_CLIENT_INSTALL_PATH replaces Mac Steam's folder (steamclient.dylib). Two modes:
# - arm64 (ship-base spec §7), when MACNEUTRON_ARM64_APP names a wine.app: directly in the booted prefix
#   MACNEUTRON_ARM64_PREFIX.
# - launcher (release spec §9 L3), when MACNEUTRON_TOOL_DIR names a tool folder (`macneutron install … --steam-exe`):
#   through its `launch waitforexitandrun`, as Steam starts a game, in the compat folder STEAM_COMPAT_DATA_PATH
#   (default $TMPDIR/macneutron probe/compat). The launcher prepares the prefix, copies the bridge in and, without
#   ACCOUNT, fills MACNEUTRON_STEAM_ACCOUNT from Steam's loginusers.vdf.
#   bridge/probe.sh --redact-self-test: checks PROBE_REDACT's filter on fake rows, no Wine needed.
set -eu
