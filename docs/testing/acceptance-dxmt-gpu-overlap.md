# GPU work overlap acceptance test (DXMT fork, sub-project 4, second slice)

Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-01-macneutron-gpu-overlap-design.md` §7. Manual, once per milestone, on a Mac
with D3DMetal (GPTK imported) and SMITE 2 installed. Record results at the bottom.

## Steps

1. **Tests:** `make dxmt-check` and `make test` pass.
2. **Install:** with SMITE 2 closed, `.build/release/macneutron install-dxmt build/dxmt`.
3. **Overlap run:** SMITE 2 with launch options `/usr/bin/env DXMT_D3D12_SM6=1 %command%`.
   - Start a practice match and stand still in one spot, the same spot in every run of the milestone (note it in the
     results).
   - Meanwhile: `python3 dxmt/tools/gpu-trace.py $(pgrep -f Hemingway-Win64-Shipping | head -1)`.
   - Play about two minutes, then quit to the desktop.
   - Run `python3 dxmt/tools/gpu-trace.py "<PEX_Timeline csv>"` with the newest `PEX_Timeline_*.csv` in
     `~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/2437170/pfx/drive_c/users/crossover/AppData/Local/SMITE2Alpha/Saved/Logs`.
4. **Strict run (control):** the same, with `/usr/bin/env DXMT_D3D12_SM6=1 DXMT_D3D12_SERIAL=1 %command%`.
5. **Pass:**
   - The picture is the same in both runs, by eye: no flicker, no missing or corrupted surfaces.
   - GPU busy per frame is lower in step 3 than in step 4, and lower than §2's 12.5 ms. The channel sum exceeds the
     union by more in step 3 than in step 4.
   - The frame period is shorter in step 3 than in step 4.
   - A milestone that measures no gain is recorded as such, and the next milestone's plan says whether it still goes
     ahead.

F9 dumps run in strict order, so they can't show an M1 or M2 ordering bug. M3 and M4, which change the passes,
compare F9 dumps.

## Results

| Milestone | Date | Overlap (step 3) | Strict (step 4) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| M1 | 2026-10-01 | Metal trace: period 16.14 ms (62 fps), GPU busy 12.32 ms, idle 3.81 ms; channels Compute 9.7%, Fragment 43.0%, Vertex 22.1%, sum 74.8% vs union 74.5%. PEX: median 16.22 ms, p90 22.04 ms (GPU 14.33 ms, RHI 15.28 ms) | Metal trace: period 15.52 ms (64 fps), GPU busy 13.20 ms, idle 2.31 ms; channels Compute 10.3%, Fragment 50.7%, Vertex 22.9%, sum 83.9% vs union 83.7%. PEX: median 15.81 ms, p90 20.63 ms (GPU 15.07 ms, RHI 14.90 ms) | Fork 7f8bb7e, macOS 26A434, a practice-match spot the user chose, the same in both runs; `DXMT_D3D12_SERIAL=1` confirmed in the control run's processes. **GPU time per frame fell 0.9 ms (7%) and is below §2's 12.5 ms, but the frame rate did not rise:** the time saved became GPU idle time (3.8 against 2.3 ms), so something other than GPU work now sets the pace; the channels barely overlap in either run. The picture looked the same in both runs (no flicker or corrupted surfaces). |
| M2 | 2026-10-01 | Metal trace: period 16.11 ms (62 fps), GPU busy 12.44 ms, idle 3.68 ms; channels Compute 9.4%, Fragment 44.6%, Vertex 22.0%, sum 76.0% vs union 75.7%. PEX: median 16.07 ms, p90 24.66 ms (GPU 14.36 ms, RHI 15.10 ms) | Metal trace: period 16.48 ms (61 fps), GPU busy 13.77 ms, idle 2.72 ms; channels Compute 9.9%, Fragment 50.6%, Vertex 21.7%, sum 82.1% vs union 81.9%. PEX: median 16.60 ms, p90 22.36 ms (GPU 15.90 ms, RHI 15.61 ms) | Fork 57d99c8, macOS 26A434, the user's spot; `DXMT_D3D12_SERIAL=1` confirmed in the control run's processes. **GPU time per frame 10% lower than the control (1.3 ms) and the frame 0.5 ms shorter; against M1's overlap run, no further change** (12.44 against 12.32 ms busy, the same frame period). The frame-period differences between runs (M1's control was the faster one) are within run-to-run noise; the GPU saving is the consistent result, and the time saved still becomes GPU idle time. The picture looked the same in both runs. The user heard wonky audio in the control run (strict order, as before M1), with Teams also running. |
| A | 2026-10-01 | Metal trace: period 13.66 ms (73 fps), GPU busy 9.73 ms, idle 3.95 ms (between encoders 3.13, between command buffers 1.06, waiting for the CPU 0.14); channels Compute 12.5%, Fragment 32.0%, Vertex 25.1%, sum 69.6% vs union 69.0%. PEX: median 14.01 ms, p90 23.45 ms (GPU 11.75 ms, RHI 12.64 ms) | Metal trace: period 12.15 ms (82 fps), GPU busy 9.56 ms, idle 2.57 ms (between encoders 1.71, between command buffers 0.87, waiting for the CPU 0.20); channels Compute 11.6%, Fragment 38.9%, Vertex 27.2%, sum 77.8% vs union 77.4%. PEX: median 12.87 ms, p90 21.49 ms (GPU 11.13 ms, RHI 11.72 ms) | Fork 530af0e, macOS 26A434, a spot with a lighter scene than M1/M2's (busy 9.6–9.7 ms against 12.4–13.8); `DXMT_D3D12_SERIAL=1` confirmed in the control run's processes; the game looked and behaved the same in both runs. **Strict order is faster here: 12.2 against 13.7 ms per frame (PEX 12.9 against 14.0).** One fence per group did not remove the idle overlap adds between encoders (3.13 against 1.71 ms), and overlap saved no GPU work at this spot. |
| B | 2026-10-01 | Default, strict order now (`DXMT_D3D12_SM6=1` only): period 12.29 ms (81 fps), GPU busy 9.57 ms, idle 2.70 ms (between encoders 1.89, between command buffers 0.94, waiting for the CPU 0.15). PEX: median 12.99 ms, p90 15.83 ms (GPU 11.24 ms, RHI 11.34 ms) | Overlap (`DXMT_D3D12_OVERLAP=1`): period 12.40 ms (81 fps), GPU busy 9.19 ms, idle 3.22 ms (between encoders 2.26, between command buffers 1.05, waiting for the CPU 0.12). PEX: median 12.37 ms, p90 23.07 ms (GPU 10.53 ms, RHI 10.97 ms) | Fork e0af547, A's spot. Metal command buffers per frame: 14.2 (6,026 in 424 frames), against about 32 before B; the ones B removed held only a `Signal` or `Wait`, and about 10 per frame still carry GPU work, so **the idle between command buffers is unchanged (0.94 against A's 0.87 ms) and so is the frame (12.3 against 12.2 ms)**. Strict order's p90 fell to 15.8 ms (A's strict run: 21.5 ms). Overlap and strict order are level this time (12.4 against 12.3 ms). The game looked and felt the same as in A. **Caveat:** the user changed the game's resolution at some point during B's runs, so B's numbers may not compare with A's or with each other. |
| M3 | 2026-10-01 | Default (strict order, B, M3): period 12.23 ms (82 fps), GPU busy 9.53 ms, idle 2.69 ms (between encoders 1.86, between command buffers 0.98, waiting for the CPU 0.16). PEX: median 12.31 ms, p90 14.14 ms (GPU 10.85 ms, RHI 11.01 ms) | Stats run (`DXMT_DXIL_DUMP`, `DXMT_STATS`, first 5 s): per frame 118.8 render passes, **0.3 merged**, 0.3 timestamp blits folded, **149.7 blit encoders**, 34.5 compute and 35.5 clear passes, 40.3 command buffers | Fork 21d9955, A's spot, one resolution. **No change against B (12.29 ms): M3 almost never merges in SMITE**, so the base pass still splits; about 150 blit encoders per frame (more than render passes) are the next lead. A red or pink flash on one ability also shows with `DXMT_D3D12_MERGE=0` and on the build before this work (`b31e856`), and not on D3DMetal: an older DXMT bug, tracked separately. D3DMetal at the same spot: PEX median 8.97 ms (111 fps), RHI 1.33 ms. |

**Reading M1 and M2's numbers** (`gpu-trace.py` since it also adds up each channel's intervals): in all four runs each
channel's intervals add up to exactly its busy share, and the channels' sum is within 0.3 points of their union. So no
work runs side by side, within a channel or across channels. The GPU time saved is the Fragment channel's share
shrinking (50.7% to 43.0% in M1, 50.6% to 44.6% in M2) with the same passes: the encoders' fragment work finishes
sooner when it no longer ends at a fence every later encoder waits on. Overlap proper is still to come (M3's unsplit
passes, and the idle time M5 traces).
