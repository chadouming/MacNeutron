# xcrun for DXMT's meson build (wine-arm64/build.sh step 7; arm64 release Ruling 20). DXMT compiles each .metal file as
# `xcrun -sdk macosx metal -o <out> -c <in> <args>...`; metal writes <in>'s absolute path into the AIR module
# (air.source_file_name, which DXMT's airconv erases before it links the module) and ignores -ffile-prefix-map. So the
# file goes in on stdin, with its folder on the include path (its quoted includes) and its own name as the main file's
# (the module name and static initialisers' names stay as they were): the same module without that path. Anything
# else is xcrun's.
