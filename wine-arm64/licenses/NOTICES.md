# Notices that live only in source headers

`wine.app` contains code whose licence notice is in its source files, not in a licence file of its own. Each section
names the component, the binaries it is compiled into, the file the notice is quoted from (in the source tree pinned in
`SOURCE`), and the notice itself. The licence files of the components (`wine/`, `fex/`, `llvm/`, `llvm-mingw/`,
`freetype/`, `gnutls/`, `nettle/`, `gmp/`, `lsteamclient/`, `macneutron/`, and `../DXMT/` for DXMT) are beside this
file; `README` says where each component's source is.

## SoftFloat-3e (in FEX: `libarm64ecfex.dll`)

From FEX's `External/SoftFloat-3e/include/SoftFloat-3e/primitiveTypes.h` (every file in `External/SoftFloat-3e`
carries the same notice):

```
This C header file is part of the SoftFloat IEEE Floating-Point Arithmetic
Package, Release 3e, by John R. Hauser.

From FEX's `Source/Windows/Common/CRT/Musl/fmod.c` (and the other musl files there; `strtoimax.c`, `strtoll.c`,
`strtoull.c` and `strtoumax.c` say 2005-2011), under the MIT licence below:

## Madeira (in FEX: `libarm64ecfex.dll`; in Wine: `ntdll.dll`)

FEX patches 0003 and 0004 come from Will Faust's Madeira commits (`willfaust/FEX`, branch `ios-port-2607`), and patch
0005 is derived from Madeira's dual-map commits; all are dated before 2026-08-28 and are used under the MIT licence
below. From
`LICENSE-MADEIRA.md` in `https://github.com/willfaust/FEX.git` (as of commit `26859e184a`):

```
- **Modifications published earlier, while this repository presented itself as
  MIT, were granted under MIT. That grant cannot be revoked.** Only
  contributions made from 2026-08-28 onward are GPL-only. Anyone who already has a
  copy keeps their MIT rights to it.
```

Wine patch 0009 is adapted from Madeira's Wine commits on its LGPL branch `madeira-lgpl`; it is LGPL-2.1+ like the rest
of Wine (`wine/LICENSE`).

## msync (in Wine: `ntdll.so`, `wineserver`)

Wine patch 0015 is CodeWeavers' CrossOver 26.3 msync, as carried on `dappermint/winecx` branch `cx/wine1117` with
millia ampora's msync commits there; it is LGPL-2.1+ like the rest of Wine (`wine/LICENSE`). From the patch's
`dlls/ntdll/unix/msync.c` (and its `msync.h`, `server/msync.c` and `server/msync.h`):

```
Copyright (C) 2018 Zebediah Figura
Copyright (C) 2023 Marc-Aurel Zent
```

Its inline `mach_msg2()` and `mach_msg2_internal()` helpers (in `dlls/ntdll/unix/msync.c` and `server/msync.c`) are, in
the patch's words, "taken and slightly adapted from xnu/libsyscall/mach/mach_msg.c": Apple's xnu, Copyright Apple
Inc., under the Apple Public Source License 2.0 (https://opensource.apple.com/apsl/).
