# Builds Wine's own conformance tests for check.sh's winetests step (batch Task 8): the ntdll, kernel32, atl, atl100,
# msvcirt and (batch Task 6) msvcrt test programs of each lane, in build/wine-arm64-tests/winetests/<lane>/ (arm64,
# arm64ec, x64).
# Why two more trees: wine-build is configured --disable-tests (build.sh), and an ARM64X tree links each test as one
# ARM64X exe, which runs only its ARM64 view (tools/makedep.c: get_link_arch and the ARM64X setup). So the tests come
# from two test-only trees on wine-build's tools, neither staged into wine.app: wine-tests-arm64 (aarch64) and
# wine-tests-ec (arm64ec, with x86_64 as a full PE arch). To configure one again, remove its folder. Needs
# `make wine-arm64`. BUILD_DIR replaces build/.
